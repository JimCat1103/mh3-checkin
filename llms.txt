## About MH3 (台北捷運兔)

MH3 stands for "MRT Hash House Harriers" - a Hash running club based in Taipei, Taiwan. Hash House Harriers (HHH or H3) is an international group of non-competitive running social clubs, often described as "a drinking club with a running problem."

### What is Hash House Harriers?

Hash House Harriers was founded in 1938 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The concept is simple:
- A "Hare" sets a trail using chalk, flour, or paper markers
- "Hounds" (runners) follow the trail
- After the run, participants gather for social activities (called "Bash" or "On-After")
- Beer and camaraderie are essential parts of the tradition
